# document-parser

Please note:
This is a project from 2006. Though still being functional, this is extremely outdated code in a terrible code style. I strongly recommend to only use this for research purposes with a distant view, knowing that most of it belongs to the "bad examples".

However, this tool helped during that time a lot when many convenient tools were not yet available on the market.
